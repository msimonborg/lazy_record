# LazyRecord

LazyRecord writes a bunch of boilerplate code for your POROs, similarly to what you'd expect ActiveRecord to do for your database-backed objects. This project is an attempt to understand and explore dynamic programming techniques in Ruby, and demystify some of the Rails magic. Maybe someone will find it useful.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lazy_record'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lazy_record

## Usage

All objects that inherit from `LazyRecord::Base` get block syntax added to their `#initialize` method.

```ruby
class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
end

thing = Thing.new do |t|
  t.inspect
end
# => #<Thing id: 1>
```
Every LazyRecord object is assigned an auto-incrementing ID after initialization. IDs reset when the program is terminated.

Use `lr_attr_accessor` like you would use `attr_accessor`. You'll get hash syntax in your `#intialize` method for attribute setting.

```ruby
class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :stuff, :junk
end

thing = Thing.new stuff: 'stuff' do |t|
  t.junk = 'junk'
end
# => #<Thing id: 1, stuff: "stuff", junk: "junk">
```

Validate presence of attributes with `lr_validates` like you would with ActiveRecord. Failed validations will return false and the ID will not be incremented. More validation options coming in the future.

```ruby
class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :stuff, :junk
  lr_validates :stuff, presence: true
end

thing = Thing.new junk: 'junk'
ArgumentError
stuff must be given
#<Thing id: nil, stuff: nil, junk: "junk">
# => false
```
Use `lr_has_many` to set up associated collections of another class. `lr_belongs_to` will be added in a future update.

```ruby
class Whatever < LazyRecord::Base
end

class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :stuff, :junk
  lr_validates :stuff, presence: true
  lr_has_many :whatevers
end

whatever = Whatever.new
# => #<Whatever id: 1>

thing = Thing.new do |t|
  t.stuff = 'stuff'
  t.whatevers << whatever
end
# => #<Thing id: 1, stuff: "stuff", junk: nil>

thing.whatevers
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 1>]>
```

Use `lr_scope` and `#where` to create class scope methods and query objects. Works just like ActiveRecord scopes, including scope chaining. Only since it is all Ruby and no SQL, use `==` as the comparison operator.

```ruby
class Whatever < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :party_value, :sleepy_value
  lr_scope :big_party, -> { where('party_value > 10') }
  lr_scope :low_sleepy, -> { where('sleepy_value < 10') }
end

class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :stuff, :junk
  lr_validates :stuff, presence: true
  lr_has_many :whatevers
end

Whatever.new party_value: 12, sleepy_value: 12
Whatever.new party_value: 13, sleepy_value: 3
Whatever.new party_value: 4, sleepy_value: 11
Whatever.new party_value: 3, sleepy_value: 5
thing = Thing.new do |t|
  t.stuff = 'stuff'
  t.whatevers = Whatever.all
end
# => #<Thing id: 1, stuff: "stuff", junk: nil>

thing.whatevers.big_party
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 1, party_value: 12, sleepy_value: 12>, #<Whatever id: 2, party_value: 13, sleepy_value: 3>]>

thing.whatevers.low_sleepy
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 2, party_value: 13, sleepy_value: 3>, #<Whatever id: 4, party_value: 3, sleepy_value: 5>]>

thing.whatevers.big_party.low_sleepy
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 2, party_value: 13, sleepy_value: 3>]>

Whatever.low_sleepy
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 2, party_value: 13, sleepy_value: 3>, #<Whatever id: 4, party_value: 3, sleepy_value: 5>]>

Whatever.where('id == 1')
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 1, party_value: 12, sleepy_value: 12>
```

Use `lr_method` for an alternative API for defining short instance methods. Can use lambda syntax or string syntax. Only good for quick one-liners. If the method references `self` of the instance, either explicitly or implicitly, it needs to use the string syntax, since any variables not passed into the lambda will be evaluated in the context of the Class level scope.

```ruby
class Whatever < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :party_value, :sleepy_value, :right
  lr_scope :big_party, -> { where('party_value > 10') }
  lr_scope :low_sleepy, -> { where('sleepy_value < 10') }
end

class Thing < LazyRecord::Base
  lr_attr_accessor :stuff, :junk
  lr_validates :stuff, presence: true
  lr_has_many :whatevers
  lr_method :speak, -> (string) { puts string }
  lr_method :add_whatever, 'right', 'whatevers << Whatever.new(right: right)'
end

thing = Thing.new stuff: 'stuff'
thing.speak "I'm a thing"
# I'm a thing
# => nil

thing.add_whatever(true)
# => [#<Whatever id: 1, party_value: nil, sleepy_value: nil, right: true>]

thing.whatevers
# => #<WhateverRelation [#<Whatever id: 1, party_value: nil, sleepy_value: nil, right: true>]>
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment. There is an `example` directory with some LazyRecord classes defined.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
